# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app (recommended from the monorepo root)

   ```bash
   npm run mobile:start
   ```

   If you need to clear Metro's cache:

   ```bash
   npm run mobile:clear
   ```

   Or from the `apps/mobile` directory directly:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   Clear the cache from within `apps/mobile` with:

   ```bash
   npx expo start --clear
   ```

3. If you see a "root file not found" error, follow the Expo Router fallback:

   - Switch `apps/mobile/package.json` `main` to `index.js` temporarily.
   - Start the app again with cache clearing (`npm run mobile:clear`).
   - After the app boots, switch `main` back to `expo-router/entry`.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
